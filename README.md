<b>My name is Mian Abdul Manan Qureshi.</b><br>
I am from BSCS 6B and I have registered for your Web Tech A course.<br>
I have been always passionate about computers, and this semester thought
to try out this web development. <br>
I am more inclined towards cyber security. Would like you pursue it as a career. <br>
It seems bit tough for me as I have never tried web development. I am hoping it goes well for me, it seems interesting. <br>
However, Nowadays finding it hard to push myself to work and do better rather than just being still (due to this lockdown). <br>
Though the passion is still there and hopefully will be learning a lot from this course. <br>
